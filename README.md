# Basic Clipping

I made a distortion plugin using the JUCE framework (which you will need to install if you want to build a version for yourself). 

This is my first released plugin using Juce so it certainly isn't perfect, but I'm releasing this publicly to help other people get to grips with the framework and create their own plugins.

I'm not currently planning on maintaining this any further, though that may change in the future.
